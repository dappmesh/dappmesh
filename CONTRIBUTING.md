# Contributing to DappMesh

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to DappMesh. Your support helps us build a better project. This document provides guidelines for contributing to DappMesh. By participating in this project, I want you to know that you agree to follow its terms.

## Code of Conduct

DappMesh is committed to fostering a welcoming community. [The Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) outlines our expectations for participant behavior and the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We'd like you to read and follow our Code of Conduct in all your interactions within the project.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to our project:

- **Submit bugs and feature requests**, and help us verify as they come in
- **Review source code changes**
- **Contribute bug fixes or features**

Before you start, please check out our [Issues](https://github.com/datadiver-cloud/datadiver/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/datadiver-cloud/datadiver/pulls) to see if your contribution might already be in progress. Also, consider discussing your idea in an issue before you start coding.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and then **create a branch from an issue** you want to work on. This helps to start your local modifications with a clear focus on solving a specific problem or adding a new feature. Name your branch in a way that reflects the issue, for example, `issue-123-fix`.
2. **Ensure your code adheres** to the coding standards and guidelines specific to this project.
3. **Write or adapt tests** as needed. All new code is expected to have coverage that ensures functionality works as intended and that future changes do not break it.
4. **Document any changes** to APIs or significant code blocks. Update the README.md if your changes could impact how users interact with the project.

### Submitting Changes

1. **Commit your changes** to your branch using a descriptive commit message that follows our commit message conventions. Small, atomic commits are preferred to ensure each change can be easily reviewed and understood.
2. **Push your branch to your fork** on GitHub once you have committed your changes.
3. **Submit a pull request (PR)** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository. Include a clear description of the problem you're solving, any discussions you've had related to the issue, and the impact of your change.
4. **Review and address feedback**. Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers, who may suggest changes. Continuous discussion and improvement are encouraged until your pull request is merged into the main branch.

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Start with a brief summary of your changes in the imperative mood, e.g., "Add feature X", not "Adding" or "Added".
- Follow up with a concise description of why the change is necessary and how it solves the issue at hand.
- Include any relevant issue numbers if the commit addresses specific issues.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue on our repository and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps** that reproduce the problem in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks, we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
